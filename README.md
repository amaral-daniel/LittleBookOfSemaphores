EEL770 @ UFRJ OS synchronization problems from The Little Book of Semaphores


Here are my solutions for the problems from the book The Little Book of Semaphores available for free at https://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf

Problems consist of multithreading and deadlocks avoidance in C language.

To install each solution, simply run `make` in the desired directory and you will produce an executable.
